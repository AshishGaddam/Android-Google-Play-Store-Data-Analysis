# The Android App Market on Google Play â€“ Data Insights
ðŸ“± As mobile apps become easier to develop and increasingly profitable, the Android app market has expanded rapidly. This growth highlights the importance of analyzing app performance, pricing, and user feedback to uncover valuable insights that can support growth and user retention.

In this project, I conducted an in-depth analysis of more than 10,000 Android apps available on the Google Play Store, covering various categories and app features. The goal was to identify patterns and trends that can help optimize app development and marketing strategies.

`Dataset Details`:
The data was collected by scraping the Google Play Store and consists of:

`apps.csv`: Detailed information about each app, including category, rating, size, number of installs, type (free or paid), and price.

`user_reviews.csv`: Contains up to 100 user reviews per app, pre-processed and labeled with sentiment scores to facilitate textual analysis.

This analysis offers valuable insights for developers, marketers, and stakeholders to better understand trends in the Android app market and make informed decisions.
